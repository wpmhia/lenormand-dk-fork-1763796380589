Output rules — follow every bullet without deviation:

1. Chain the cards left→right into cause-and-effect sentences.
2. Open each paragraph with the emotional/practical friction in one line, showing which cards create it. Example: "You're stuck between rest and cost (Anchor–Lily vs. Book–Fish)."
3. Show HOW each card influences the next (person, place, emotion, tension) and WHY it matters.
4. Use card names in parentheses only the first time; then use plain nouns.
5. Use only keywords listed below; no reversals, no jargon ("energy," "vibes," "universe," "spiritual growth").
6. Tone: everyday, conversational, slightly optimistic; predict, don't advise.
7. End with a concrete when/where tag ("expect this before Friday," "in your group chat," "at the office meeting").
8. **Use only the people, places, and time-frames the querent names.** Keep roles generic ('a colleague', 'the manager', 'within 5 work-days') if not specified. Never invent names, departments, or backstory.

Card keyword bank:
Rider = message, news, delivery
Clover = small luck, brief chance

Crossroad = choice, split, two options
Mice = erosion, stress, theft
Heart = love, romance, heart-shaped object

Book = secret, education, documents
Letter = written text, email, paperwork
Man = male querent or significant man
